ldap-activerecord-gateway
=========================

This is an implementation of an LDAP server which uses active record as the data source.
The server is read-only, and can serve information from any AR model that implements the
#search(string) class method and the #to_ldap_entry instance method.

To use, configure the server by creating a conf/ldap-server.yml file (see ldap-server.example.yml).
The important bits are rails_dir, active_record_model, basedn, and port.  Once that's done,
run "./bin/ldap-server.rb start", wait for it to daemonize, and check the log file under log/ for
errors.  To stop, run "./bin/ldap-server.rb", and if you reconfigure the server or change the underlying
AR model, restart it with "./bin/ldap-server.rb restart".

To test, point your addressbook (ie: Thunderbird or OS X Address Book) at the server and run a search.

TODO: Provide example AR implementation.

Have fun.
